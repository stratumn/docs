## State definition

The state object is defined as follows, with `data` being the business data of the trace.

```ts
type State = {
  data: Record<string, any>;
  tasks: Record<string, TaskState>;
  nextActions: Record<string, NextActionState>;
  notifications: Record<string, Notification>;
  [];
};
```

### State Data

The `data` property is an object that contains the business data of the trace,
it's shape varies depending on the workflow and is mostly defined by the workflow specs.

The data are the result of the execution of the effects.

### Next actions

When an action is submitted, the `nextActions` property is set by the effects to define which actions will next be available to a group.

```ts
state.nextActions = {
  assigner: ['comment'],
  entity: ['validateClaim', 'comment'],
  admin: ['closeTrace', 'comment']
  [global.assignedOwner?.label]: ['comment'],
}
```

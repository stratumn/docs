In this section, we'll go through the folder structure of a typical process configuration project and explain each folder and file's purpose.

### Accounts

The `src/accounts/` folder is where the process's organization, its teams and its users are declared.\
By convention, each type of account is declared in a separate file, and all are exported in the `index.ts`.
To be generated, the accounts must be used in the workflow's definition.

The `files/` folder is used to store the account's avatar images.

### Environment variables

The process' environment variables are declared in the `.env` file and in the `.env.<envName>` files depending on the generation environment.\
The `src/env/index.ts` file is used to parse with a [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema and export the environment variables.\
Additionnally, the environment variables are added to the [workflow's definition](/configuration/action/effects#workflow-definitions) so that they can be used inside the actions' effects.

### Workflows

The process' workflows are defined in subfolders of the `src/workflows/` folder, as well as a shared folder which is used to declare shared constants, types and functions.\
All worklows are exported in the `index.ts` file.

### Workflow structure

Each workflow should follow the following structure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Actions" icon="file">
    Actions are defined in separate files and all are exported in the `index.ts` file.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Definitions" icon="database">
    The definitions folder is where the static data and functions are declared, see [Definitions](/configuration/action/effects#workflow-definitions) for more information.
    <ParamField path="data/repositories.ts">
      The workflow's data are declared in this file, they then can be used in the actions' effects.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="functions/index.ts">
      The workflow's functions are declared in this file, they then can be used in the actions' effects.
    </ParamField>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Types" icon="brackets-curly">
    <ParamField path="state.types.ts">
      This file is used to declare the type of the workflow's [state data](/configuration/trace#state).
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="business.types.ts">
      This file is used to declare types unrelated to the configuration itself of the workflow. For example a status enum, a list of business programs, etc.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="dsl.types.ts">
      This file is where the workflow's dsl context is instantiated.
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField path="paths.types.ts">
      This file is where the types which will be used to validate the paths used in the [UI widgets](/configuration/ui/widgets) are declared.
    </ParamField>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Shared folder

The `shared/` follows the same structure as the `workflows/` folder, 
but is used to declare shared constants, state and functions which will be automagically added to all workflows.

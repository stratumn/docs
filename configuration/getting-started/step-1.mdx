The goal of this first step is to familiarize yourself with implementing [actions](/configuration/action/definition) and [effects](/configuration/action/effects) from scratch.

The specifications of the workflow are available bellow.

## Starting the development

### Requirements

To generate a [workflow](), you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Install yarn if you don't have it already:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

### Setup the project

Clone the repository and open it in ~~Vim~~ your favorite IDE.

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<your-name>-step-1
```

Now, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```


### Generating the workflow

While developing, you'll be generating in the [staging](https://trace.staging.stratumn.com/) environment.

To generate the workflow, you'll need to export the `SU_PASSWORD` environment variable in your terminal (or directly in your `.<bash | zsh>rc file`).

```bash
export SU_PASSWORD=<provided-password>
```

Update the `YOUR_NAME` variable in the `.env.local-to-staging` file with your name.

To generate the workflow, run the following command:

```bash
yarn generate:local-to-staging
```

<Info>When generating for the first time a workflow, you'll need to generate it a second time for it to be fully functional.</Info>

<Check>That's it! You've generated your first workflow ðŸš€</Check>

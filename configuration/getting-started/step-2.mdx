The client has requested to update the workflow Order Management.

He wants to add a new group to the workflow, the `Waiter` group, and new actions to the `Client` group. He also updated the previous actions (`Prepare order` is now attributed to the `Cook` group, and the `Waiter` group has a `Receive Order` action).

Please find the specifications for a new version of the workflow in the following Excel file :

/>

Please pay attention to the following changes:

- New BPMN diagram with actions
  and groups updated
- Updated actions : Prepare Order
- New action : Receive Order, Cancel Order.

<Note>
  Please pay attention to update well the next actions for each group, and the
  trace_state updates (status, etc).
</Note>

## Upgrading the workflow version

A new version of a workflow means its tag will be updated.
In the git repository, we create a new release for each version of a workflow.

Please create a new branch for the step 2, based on the step 1 branch :

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<your-name>-step-2
```

You don't need to update the workflow ID in the .env as you only need to upgrade the previous one.

Make your changes and generate it again running the following command:

```bash
yarn generate:local-to-staging
```

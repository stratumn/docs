All views are configured using a certain number of ‘paths’-inputs which enable to localise in the data object the information we want to display, or the conditions we want to check to decide on the actual shape of the display. We use **JMESPath** to fetch the data given a path, which means in particular that deep paths into objects using ‘dot’-notation are allowed, as well as fancy indexing and filtering.
Paths defined as `“”` will be pointing at the data (traces state) root (stringified for text-type views).

- **type**: Defines the type of view to display.

All `text` views, when falling on a data to display that is actually still an object, will **stringify** it in a classical json-friendly way.Paths pointing at nothing will usually result in empty views.

So far the available view types are: `text`, `html`, `prose`, `list`, `labels`, `code`, `icon`, `date`, `activity`, `number`, `progress`.

All views is a widget, you can know more about it [here](/configuration/ui/widgets)

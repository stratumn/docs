There's multiple type of actions, with the most common type being the form action. After submission, a business logic called *effects* is usually executed.

# Basic action definition

```ts


# Form action

The form of the action is defined in the action's configuration using [react-jsonschema-form](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/), 
a package that makes it easy to create dynamic forms with a JSON Schema, as well as handle dependencies between fields.

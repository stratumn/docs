## Workflow

In Stratumn, a workflow corresponds to a business process.
It defines a set of [actions](/configuration/action) that are done in a specific order, automatically or manually by users.

  />
</Frame>

### Trace

A [trace](/configuration/trace) is an instance of a workflow.
It is created when the first action of the workflow is made, and contains all data related to the execution of the workflow.

<Info>
  In the above workflow, a new trace is created every time a customer orders
  ameal.

There's multiple type of actions, with the most common type being the form action. After submission, a business logic called [_effects_](/configuration/action/effects) is usually executed.

## Basic action definition

```ts
const form: BetterFormDef = {...};
const effects = [...],

export const placeOrder: IActionDef = {
  key: 'placeOrder',
  title: 'Place order',
  icon: 'lucide_BadgePlus',
  form: form,
  effects: effects,
  answerableComments: ['comment']
};
```

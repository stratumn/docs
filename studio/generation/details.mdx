You can access the generation details by clicking on a generation in the generation history.

You will retreive the exact same information as in the generation history, but with more details inside the **Generation details** section.

## Generation details

### Logs

Inside the **Logs** accordion, you will find the logs of the generation. These logs are useful to understand **what happened during the generation**.

<Note>
  Logs are currently mainly understandable by the Stratumn team but is likely to
  be improved in the future.

## Real-time updates

While a generation is in **running state**, logs and all other generation information are refreshed in **real-time** so you can see how it's going without having to refresh the page or waiting the generation to be finished.

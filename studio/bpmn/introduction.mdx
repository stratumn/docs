# What is BPMN?

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) was developed as a graphical notation to represent complex processes and address these challenges. 
It is maintained by the non-profit The Object Management Group (OMG) and employed by numerous organizations globally. 
The visual nature of BPMN enables greater collaboration between different teams, which isnâ€™t surprising given that studies have shown that the human brain can process visuals 15.4 times faster than text.

## Why use BPMN?

BPMN is a standard way to represent business processes. It is used to create a visual representation of a process, which can be used to communicate with stakeholders, create documentation, and automate processes.

When you create a process in Stratumn, you are creating a BPMN process.

<Warning>
The Stratumn Engine is implementing most of the BPMN 2.0 specification, but some features are not supported yet.

## How to get started

To get started, you can create a draft process in studio. The draft part of studio is like a drawing board where you can create your process.

This drawing board is save, but will not create a process in the engine.

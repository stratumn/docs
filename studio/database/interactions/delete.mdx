In order to delete a row in a Database, you first need to **select** the row you want to delete with the **checkbox** located on the left of the row.

<Note>You can select multiple rows and delete them all at once.</Note>

When you select a row, you can notice that an **interaction zone** appears on bottom of the page.

The row will be **instantly deleted** from the sheet.

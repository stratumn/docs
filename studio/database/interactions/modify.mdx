title: 'Modify a row'
---

In order to modify a row in a Database, you first need to **double click** on the cell of the row you want to modify. Then, **two behaviors** are possible.

## Classic cell

If the cell is containing **normal values** like numbers or characters you can **directly modify** the value of the cell by double clicking on it and start typing.

  style={{ borderRadius: '1rem' }}
/>

Then, you can either press **Enter** to save the modification or **Escape** to cancel it.

<Info>
  Clicking anywhere outside the cell but inside the grid (e.g. clicking on
  another cell) will also save the modification.
</Info>

<Note>
  If you are not sure if your modification has been saved, you can simply
  refresh the page.

### Regex validation

Sometimes, for security reasons, you may want to **validate** the value of a cell before saving it by using a regular expression.
These are defined by the client and configured by the Stratumn team and if you try to save a cell modification with an **invalid value**, the modification will be **rolled back** and a custom message will be displayed.

## Reference cell

If the cell is a **reference cell**, double-clicking on it will open a **multi-select menu**.

<img
  src="/studio/database/images/multiSelect.jpg"
  style={{ borderRadius: '1rem' }}
/>

Inside the multi-select menu, **first** are displayed the rows that are **already selected**.

Then, you can select any additional row by **clicking on it**, it's checkbox will be **checked**.

Finally, in order to **save the modification**, you have 2 options:

- Directly click **outside the cell** but inside the grid (e.g. another cell), this will instantly **save the modification**.

- First, press **Escape** or click on the **Close** button at the bottom of the multi-select menu to close the menu with your modifications **temporarily saved**.
  - Then, press **Enter** or click **outside the cell** but inside the grid to **definitively save the modification**.

  style={{ borderRadius: '1rem' }}
/>

<Note>
  Same as for the classic cell, if you are not sure if your modification has
  been saved, you can refresh the page.

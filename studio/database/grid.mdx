# What is a Grid ?

A Grid is the **visual representation** of a Sheet. It's represented as a table with rows and columns.

## Columns

Columns are defined by the client and configured by the Stratumn team. There are **two specific types** of columns that you must be aware of.

### Primary Key

This type of column is used to identify a row, it **cannot be empty** and is used as a **display value** in case the row is referenced elsewhere.

It can be easily identified by the **little blue key** displayed in the column header:

  style={{ borderRadius: '1rem' }}
/>

### Reference

This type of column is used to symbolize a link with **another Sheet**.

It can be easily identified by the **blue chips** representing selected rows of the other Sheet inside any cell of the column.

Other types of columns are:

- **Text**: A simple text column.
- **Number**: A number column.
- **Boolean**: A boolean column taking form of a checkbox.
- **Date**: A date column.

### Filters

Filters can be applied to a column by clicking on the **filter icon** in the column header.

**Alphabetical filters** sorting is also available by clicking anywhere inside the column header. A little arrow will show up to indicate the sorting direction.

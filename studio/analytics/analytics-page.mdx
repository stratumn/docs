## Workflow settings Analytics Page

<Frame caption="Studio - Workflow  - Analytics settings page">
  <img src="/images/studio/analytics/analytics_list.png" alt="etl_list" />
</Frame>

Go to a process, then in the workflow page.
You can see in the menu "Analytics".
Go to this page and you will find the ETL page.
It has two parts :

- The ETL card, with the global info about the ETL
- A paginated list of ETL instances, the pods, in the most recent one being launched order.

ETL is a job so it has a `id`, `name`, `status`, a `cron_expression` if the ETL is scheduled to run periodically (see [below](#cron-expression) ), and all others properties of a Job.

## Controls

<Frame caption="ETL card">
  <img src="/images/studio/analytics/analytics_controls.png" alt="controls" />
</Frame>

Click on the ETL controls accordion, you will see the card revealing 4 buttons :

- Trigger : to trigger the etl instantly (It will create a Pod from this etl)
- Edit: to edit the etl details (see [Edit](#edit) )
- Pause: Clicking on it will pause the ETL, which will set its status to `RECEIVED` and put the cronjob on hold. The ETL won't run until the pause is active. Clicking again will resume the ETL and starts the cronjob, and sets its status to `IN_PROGRESS`
- Delete: will not delete the ETL job in the database but sets its status to `COMPLETED`, in which case Studio won't show them on the page anymore.

## Edit

On the ETL card, You can edit he name and cron expression directly by clicking on it :

    alt="analytics_cron_edit"
  />
</Frame>

You can edit the rest of the ETL by opening the controls and click on `Edit`. A modal opens :

<Frame caption="ETL edit modal">
  <img src="/images/studio/analytics/analytics_edit.png" alt="etl_edit" />
</Frame>

Please refer to [ETL DTO](/studio/analytics/analytics-dto#dto) to check all the different properties. Beware, some properties will change the etl management (such as schema, database, and so on.)

## ETL pods and logs

<Frame caption="ETL pods">
  <img
    src="/images/studio/analytics/analytics_details_pods.png"
    alt="etl_pods"
  />
</Frame>

When you go to an etl pod details, you will find a page with the summary of the etl job (name, status, cron_expression) and the informations about the etl pod : the pod status, when it has been triggered, the docker image used, and the logs from the kubernetes pod job.

<Info>
  To see the logs in Studio, you will need to enable `store_execution_logs` to
  `true` inside `metadata`. Please see this
  [here](/studio/analytics/analytics-dto#param-metadata)

## Cron expression

Cron expressions are a powerful way to schedule tasks in Unix-based systems and various job schedulers. They consist of a string with five to seven fields that define a time-based schedule.

**Cron Expression Format** A standard cron expression consists of five fields, while extended versions may have six or seven:

```
*    *    *    *    *    Command to execute
|    |    |    |    |
|    |    |    |    +---- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
|    |    |    +--------- Month (1 - 12)
|    |    +-------------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
|    +------------------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------------------ Minute (0 - 59)
```

**Examples of Cron Expressions**

1. `0 0 * * *` - Runs daily at midnight.
2. `0 */2 * * *` - Runs every 2 hours.
3. `*/30 * * * *` - Runs every 30 minute.
4. `0 0 * * 1` - Runs every week on Monday at midnight.
5. `0 0 1 * *` - Runs every month on the 1st at midnight.

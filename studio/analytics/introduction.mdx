The Analytics ETL system is a service designed to extract data from various sources, transform it according to business logic, and load it into the Analytics platform.

Analytics-ETL represents a pipeline involving several Stratumn microservices : Launcher-API for creating/updating/scheduling ETLs, Metabase for creating and managing dashboard, and Analytics-API for displaying the dashboard on Analytics-UI.

## 1. Extract

Data is fetched from PostgreSQL databases (account, trace).

## 2. Transform

Transformation steps can include:

- Filtering: Apply conditions to exclude unnecessary data.

- Data Enrichment: Add derived fields or perform lookups.

- Aggregation: Summarize data for analytics use.

## 3. Load

Transformed data is stored in a dedicated database (Analytics Database) on the kubernetes cluster.

## What body for the trace input

The body required in the `traceInput` is dependant on the action you want to perform.

Each body is different for each action. Stratumn will guide you regarding the body.

## How to upload files

To upload a file, add a new body parameter with the file as value. 
The parameter must be added to the body as a key-value pair where the key file and the value is the parameter. 

In the example, the file is uploaded in the userFile parameter. 
This parameter is then used in the `traceInput` object to reference 
the file file: `[{file: 'userFile'}]`. 

If several files need to be uploaded, they can be added to the body as new parameters. The data object must then be updated to reference the files : file: `[{file: 'userFile'}, {file: 'userFile2'}]`
